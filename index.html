  <h1>I Thought So</h1>
  <p class="blog-meta">By <b>Divanshi</b> | <em>January 10, 2020</em></p>

  <div class="blog-content">
    <p>This may come across as a rant, but bear with me. I promise I’ll make it worth your time.</p>
    <p>You know those moments where you’ve got a thousand thoughts, and yet none make it to your mouth?... <em>“Yes! I feel that too.”</em></p>
    <p>It’s not always easy, navigating through doubts, expectations, and that little voice in your head saying <em>"what if?"</em>...</p>
    <p>So this space — this tiny corner of the internet — is where I’ll share my chaos, my clarity, and everything in between...</p>
    <p>With love, <br><strong>Divanshi</strong></p>
