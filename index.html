    <p>This may come across as a rant, but bear with me. I promise I’ll make it worth your time.</p>
    <p>You know those moments where you’ve got a thousand thoughts, and yet none make it to your mouth? That’s me. That’s been me for the longest time. So here I am, writing instead — pouring my brain out in the hope that someone somewhere will go, “Yes! I feel that too.”</p>
    <p>It's not always easy, navigating through doubts, expectations, and that little voice in your head saying <em>"what if?"</em> But here's the truth I’m beginning to lean into: sometimes, all you can do is take a deep breath, show up, and let life happen.</p>
    <p>So this space — this tiny corner of the internet — is where I’ll share my chaos, my clarity, and everything in between. If you’re here, thank you. You matter.</p>
    <p>With love,<br><strong>Divanshi</strong></p>
